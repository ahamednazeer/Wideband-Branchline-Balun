Design and Simulation of a Wideband Branchline Balun
Abstract
A balun (balanced-to-unbalanced transformer) is a critical RF/microwave component used
to convert single-ended signals into balanced signals with equal amplitude and opposite
phase. Conventional branchline baluns suffer from narrow bandwidth, which limits their
use in modern wideband wireless systems. This project focuses on the design and
simulation of a wideband branchline balun operating at 2.4 GHz. A multistage branchline
configuration is employed to enhance bandwidth while maintaining good impedance
matching, isolation, and phase balance. The balun is designed and simulated using
microwave CAD tools, and its performance is evaluated using S-parameters, phase response,
and VSWR analysis.
Introduction
With the rapid growth of wireless communication systems such as WLAN, WiMAX, and IoT,
RF front-end components must support wide bandwidth and stable performance. Baluns
are widely used in mixers, power amplifiers, antennas, and differential circuits. Among
different balun structures, the branchline balun is popular due to its planar structure and
ease of fabrication. However, conventional branchline baluns operate effectively only
around a narrow frequency range. This project investigates a wideband branchline balun
design that overcomes bandwidth limitations while preserving simplicity and low cost.
Problem Statement
Conventional branchline baluns provide good performance only at a single design frequency
and exhibit poor return loss and phase imbalance outside this narrow band. As modern
wireless systems require wider operating bandwidths, there is a need to enhance the
bandwidth of branchline baluns without significantly increasing design complexity, cost, or
loss. The challenge is to achieve wide bandwidth, good impedance matching, equal power
division, and 180-degree phase difference using a planar microstrip structure.
Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to design a wideband branchline balun operating at
2.4 GHz, to improve bandwidth using a multistage branchline approach, to analyze the
balun performance using simulation tools, and to evaluate key parameters such as return
loss, insertion loss, phase difference, isolation, and VSWR. Another objective is to compare
the wideband design with a conventional branchline balun to demonstrate performance
improvement.
Proposed System
The proposed system consists of a two-stage branchline balun implemented using
microstrip transmission lines. Each stage contains quarter-wavelength series arms and half-
wavelength shunt arms designed for a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. By cascading
multiple stages, impedance matching is improved over a wider frequency range. The balun
is designed on an FR4 substrate to ensure low fabrication cost and easy integration with
other RF circuits.
Tech Stack
The project uses microwave simulation software such as ADS or HFSS for design and
analysis. FR4 substrate material with a dielectric constant of 4.4 and thickness of 1.6 mm is
used for the microstrip layout. Standard RF design equations are applied for calculating
transmission line dimensions. S-parameter analysis is used to evaluate performance
metrics.
Scope and Limitations
The scope of this project is limited to the design and simulation of a wideband branchline
balun at 2.4 GHz. Fabrication and experimental validation are not included. While
bandwidth is significantly improved, increasing the number of stages results in larger
circuit size. Advanced miniaturization techniques are not explored in this work.
Stakeholders & User Roles
The primary stakeholders include RF design engineers, students, and researchers working
in microwave communication systems. Students use the design for academic learning,
researchers use it as a reference for further enhancement, and engineers can adapt the
design for practical wireless applications.
System Architecture
The system architecture consists of an unbalanced input port connected to a multistage
branchline network that splits the signal into two balanced output ports. The outputs
deliver equal power with a 180-degree phase difference. Each stage acts as an impedance-
matching section, collectively improving wideband performance.
Methodology
The methodology begins with the design of a conventional branchline balun using
transmission line theory. The design is then extended to a two-stage configuration to
improve bandwidth. Transmission line dimensions are calculated, and the layout is
simulated using microwave CAD tools. S-parameters, phase response, and VSWR are
analyzed across a wide frequency range. Results are compared with conventional designs to
validate improvement.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the design and simulation of a wideband branchline
balun using a multistage approach. The proposed design achieves enhanced bandwidth
while maintaining good impedance matching, equal power division, and near-ideal phase
difference. The planar structure and low-cost substrate make the design suitable for
modern wireless applications. The work provides a strong foundation for future fabrication,
miniaturization, and multi-band extensions.
